## ARC Prize 2026 - ARC-AGI-3

## ARC Prize 2026 - ARC-AGI-3

## Dataset Description

ARC-AGI-3 is an **Interactive Reasoning Benchmark** designed to measure an AI agent's ability to generalize in novel, unseen environments. Unlike traditional static benchmarks used to evaluate LLMs and reasoning systems, ARC-AGI-3 evaluates frontier AI agent systems on exploration, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment.

Full documentation: [docs.arcprize.org](https://docs.arcprize.org/)

## Games (Environments)

ARC-AGI-3 consists of **hand-crafted interactive environments** that test abstraction and reasoning. Each game presents a unique challenge that your agent must explore, understand, and solve.

### How Games Work

- Your agent receives **frames** — JSON objects containing the current game state and metadata.
- Each frame includes a **grid** (max 64×64) with integer cell values 0–15 representing different states/colors, using a (0,0) top-left coordinate system.
- Your agent responds with **actions** to interact with the environment.
- Each game has multiple **levels** of increasing difficulty.
- A game can be in one of three states: `NOT_FINISHED`, `WIN`, or `GAME_OVER`.

### Available Actions

Agents interact with environments using up to 7 actions:

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RESET` | Start or restart the game |
| `ACTION1` – `ACTION5` | Simple actions (e.g., move up/down/left/right, interact) |
| `ACTION6` | Complex action requiring `(x, y)` coordinates |
| `ACTION7` | Additional simple action |

Each game defines which actions are available and what they do. The meaning of actions varies per game — your agent must figure out what each action does through exploration.

### Public Games

A set of public games is available for development and practice at [arcprize.org](https://arcprize.org/arc-agi/3). In addition, public game files are available in the `environment_files` folder on this page.

> **Note:** Competition evaluation uses a **separate, private set of 110 games** that your agent has never seen. Half of these are used for the Public Leaderboard score, and the other half for the Private Leaderboard score.

## Scoring

AI agents are scored on **two criteria**:

1. **Completion** — How many levels did the agent complete in each game?
2. **Efficiency** — How many actions did the agent take to complete each level, compared to a human baseline?

### Scoring Method

- For each level completed, the agent's action count is compared to a human baseline (first-time test-testers).
- **Per-level score** = `min(human_actions / agent_actions, 1.0)`, then **squared** (a raw score of 0.5 becomes 0.25).
- **Per-game score** = Weighted average of level scores (weighted by level index, 1-indexed).
- **Total score** = Average of all individual game scores.
- Final output is a score between **0%–100%**.

## ARC-AGI Toolkit

The [`arc-agi`](https://github.com/arcprize/arc-agi) Python package provides the core toolkit for interacting with ARC-AGI-3 environments.

## Building Agents

The [ARC-AGI-3-Agents](https://github.com/arcprize/ARC-AGI-3-Agents) repository provides the framework for building and running agents.

### Agent Architecture

An agent plays ARC-AGI-3 by implementing two core methods:

1. **`is_done(frames, latest_frame)`** — Decide if the agent should stop playing
2. **`choose_action(frames, latest_frame)`** — Choose which action to take given the current game state

A **Swarm** orchestrates multiple agent instances across all available games in parallel.

### Agent Lifecycle

1. Get the list of available games from the API
2. Open a scorecard (tracks performance)
3. For each game, `RESET` to start, then take actions based on the agent's strategy
4. Close the scorecard when all games are complete
